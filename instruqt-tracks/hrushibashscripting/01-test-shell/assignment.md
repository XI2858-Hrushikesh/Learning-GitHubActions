# What is a sudo user?

Since administering the Linux system as the root user is highly discouraged, a system administrator needs to grant a regular user some level of privilege to execute some (or all) root commands.

Sudo is a program that grants regular users permissions to run commands with root privileges or as another user. A sudo user is, therefore, a regular Linux user with elevated privileges to run commands as a root user or another regular user, the default being the root user. In addition, you can configure sudo to restrict a sudo user to a handful of commands or allow them to run all commands as the root user. We will cover these scenarios in depth later on in this guide.

# We will see details on Sudo user in some other challenge.
